    <h1>Short story about me</h1>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Vladyslav Shaposhnikov, I am a junior python developer and It is my portfolio site. 
        I study programming in free time for an almost 1,5 years. Firstly, I started interesting programming when 
        I finished university in the faculty of Tourism in Wroclaw Poland. I watched some videos on YouTube about 
        what you can do with programming and I decided to try it. Later I found some books about programming languages, 
        tutorials and articles in the internet. In my opinion, I spend a lot of time to get some theoretical knowledge, 
        I did several projects by following tutorials in internet and also I tried doing my own projects like this one.
